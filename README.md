## Usage / Project Setup

### Back-end

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AloysiussG/backend-dexa.git
cd backend-dexa
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create MySQL database:

```bash
CREATE DATABASE dexagroup_seto;
```

Setup **.env** or environment variables for database URL (MySQL):

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:@localhost:3306/dexagroup_seto"
```

**(Optional)** Add environment variables for URL. For temporary quick test, the URL endpoints are already stored in the files. The default port of the back-end are set to 8000. Please see the **project directories**.

```env
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:@localhost:3306/dexagroup_seto"

NEXT_PUBLIC_FRONTEND_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_APP_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Run the migration:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Run database seeder. You can see all the data that will be generated inside **src/seeder/data** folder, with the name of **users.json** and **attendances.json**.

```bash
npm run seed
```

Run the project:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

### Front-end

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AloysiussG/frontend-dexa.git
cd frontend-dexa
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

**(Optional)** Setup environment variables. For temporary quick test, the URL endpoints are already stored in the files. The default port of the front-end are set to 3000. Please see the **project directories**.

## Dummy Data for Testing (Login)

For quick testing of the application, you can use the following **dummy users**. These users are pre-seeded in the back-end database from the file **after you run the seeder from the Usage/Project Setup section**:

You can log in using the **email** and **password** provided below. All passwords are set to `password` for testing purposes.

| Name          | Email                     | Password | Role     |
| ------------- | ------------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| Alice HR      | alice.hr@company.com      | password | HR       |
| David HR      | david.hr@company.com      | password | HR       |
| Bob Worker    | bob.worker@company.com    | password | Employee |
| Charlie Staff | charlie.staff@company.com | password | Employee |

### How to Use the App

1. Start the back-end and front-end servers as described in the **Usage/Project Setup** section.
2. Open the login page:

   ```arduino
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Enter the email and password of any dummy user from the table above.
4. You will be redirected to the appropriate dashboard based on the role:
5. HR users will access employee and attendance management features, as well as daily presence dashboard.
6. Employee users will access the daily attendance dashboard.
7. You can use these accounts to test check-in, check-out, attendance viewing, and employee management features.

## Notes

- **Timezone**: Back-end stores all dates in UTC; front-end displays in Asia/Jakarta (GMT+7).
- **React Query**: Caches user and attendance data to reduce API calls.
- **React Hook Form + Zod**: Validates forms including file uploads.
- **Loading States**: Delays can be added to simulate UX feedback for buttons.
- **Token**: Authentication uses UUID tokens & HTTP Only cookie, instead of JWT. Token stored inside **users** table.
